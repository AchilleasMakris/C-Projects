# Medium Level C Programming Exercises

This folder contains medium-level C programming exercises. Each exercise is designed to help you practice and improve your C programming skills. Below is a list of the exercises with a brief description and relevant formulas where applicable.

## Exercises

1. [Fibonacci Recursion](fibonacci_recursion.c)
   - **Description:** This program calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
     $$ F(n) = 
     \begin{cases} 
     0 & \text{if } n = 0 \\
     1 & \text{if } n = 1 \\
     F(n-1) + F(n-2) & \text{if } n > 1 
     \end{cases} $$

2. [Matrix Multiplication](matrix_multiplication.c)
   - **Description:** This program performs element-wise multiplication of two 2x5 matrices and prints the results.

3. [Pascal's Triangle](pascal_triangle.c)
   - **Description:** This program generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows. Pascal's Triangle is defined as:
     $$ {n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k} $$
