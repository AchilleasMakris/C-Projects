This folder contains easy-level C programming exercises. Each exercise is designed to help you practice and improve your C programming skills. Below is a list of the exercises with a brief description.

## Exercises

1. [Anagram](anagram.c)
   - **Description:** This program checks whether two given strings are anagrams by counting the occurrences of characters ('a', 'b', 'c', and 'd') in each string and comparing their frequency distributions.

2. [Array Operations](array_operations.c)
   - **Description:** This program calculates the minimum and maximum values in a user-defined array.

3. [Calculator](calculator.c)
   - **Description:** This program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input.

4. [Even or Odd](even_odd.c)
   - **Description:** This program determines whether a given integer is even or odd.

5. [Factorial](factorial.c)
   - **Description:** This program calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer provided by the user using a recursive function.

6. [Fibonacci](fibonacci.c)
   - **Description:** This program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the N-th term, as specified by the user.

7. [Greatest Common Divisor](greatest_common_divisor.c)
   - **Description:** This program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers provided by the user using the Euclidean algorithm.

8. [Integer Reverse and Palindrome](integer_reverse_palindrome.c)
   - **Description:** This program checks if a given integer is a palindrome and reverses its digits.

9. [Largest of Three](largest_of_three.c)
   - **Description:** This program determines which of three integers entered by the user is the largest.

10. [Least Common Multiple](least_common_multiple.c)
    - **Description:** This program calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers provided by the user using a brute-force approach.

11. [Multiplication Table](multiplication_table.c)
    - **Description:** This program generates the multiplication table for a given integer from 1 to 10.

12. [Prime Finder](prime_finder.c)
    - **Description:** This program finds and prints all prime numbers within a given range [min, max].

13. [String Length](string_length.c)
    - **Description:** This program calculates the length of a string entered by the user without using the `strlen` function.

14. [Sum](sum.c)
    - **Description:** This program calculates the sum of a series of integers entered by the user.

15. [Sum of First N Numbers](sum_of_first_n_numbers.c)
    - **Description:** This program calculates the sum of integers from 1 to a user-provided number `n`.
